Event Overlap in Sports Betting

Assuming multiplier equation, given odds s, where s exists in space of [-I, -100] \union [100, +I]
	R(s) = (s - 100) / s | (s < -100)
	\union (s + 100) / 100 | (s > 100)

Further assume some arbitrary game. Assume G, A, X, are random variables for player events, which are goals, assists, and points. X is defined as X = A + G

The following markets exist across all books:
	G > _C, G < _C
	X > _C, X < _C, 
	A > _C, A < _C
		where _C is a small decimal value, usually 0.5 or 1.5

BetRivers, theScore, Bet365 make the following milestone-based market:
	G >= x (BetRivers, theScore) 
	P >= x (BetRivers, Bet365)
	X < x (BetRivers)
	A >= x (Bet365)

The only market missing is:
	G < x 
	A < x 

The objective is to formulate an expected value calculation, given an appropriate overlap in occurence. Shorting assists, goals is missing from the market, but points can be shorted...

	P(X >= x) = \sum_{i = x}^{\inf} P_X(i)
	P(A + G >= x) = ...

Assuming independence across A and G, we perform a convolution to obtain a new pdf Y = A + G.
How does one empirically determine the distributions for A and G?
